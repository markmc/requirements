== Max Versions ==

Some projects specify a maximum version for a library. This might make
sense where we know a project is very likely to break its API in a way
that will impact us but, if not, let's at l2east try using newer versions
as they are released.

python-glanceclient>=0.5.0,<2 # cinder nova
python-keystoneclient>=0.2,<0.3 # keystone
python-swiftclient>=1.2,<2 # glance

jsonschema<1 # glance

== Pinning ==

Some projects have pinned themselves to a specific version of a library.
This is likely to be a problem for packages because they will often have
the latest version of the library but upstream isn't testing it:

amqplib==0.6.1 # cinder quantum
amqplib>=0.6.1 # nova

cheetah==2.4.4 # nova

kombu # glance
kombu>=1.0.4 # nova
kombu==1.0.4 # cinder quantum

pam==0.1.4 # keystone

pastedeploy # glance keystone
pastedeploy==1.5.0 # nova quantum
pastedeploy>=1.5.0 # cinder

routes # glance keystone
routes==1.12.3 # cinder nova
routes>=1.12.3 # quantum

suds==0.4
suds>=0.4

webob>=1.2 # quantum glance
webob==1.2.3 # nova keystone cinder

== Different Minimums ==

Other projects have different minimum versions. The highest minimum
effectively becomes the minimum for them all.

python-keystoneclient>=0.2.0 # cinder nova glance quantum
python-keystoneclient>=0.2,<0.3 # keystone

python-quantumclient>=2.0 # quantum
python-quantumclient>=2.1 # nova

eventlet # keystone
eventlet>=0.9.12 # glance
eventlet>=0.9.17 # cinder nova quantum

stevedore>=0.7 # nova
stevedore>=0.8.0 # cinder

== Some With Minimum ==

Some projects specify a minimum version for a library while others
don't. The specified minimum version is effectively the minium version
for Openstack.

anyjson # glance
anyjson>=0.2.4 # cinder nova quantum

greenlet # keystone
greenlet>=0.3.1 # cinder nova glance quantum

kombu # glance
kombu>=1.0.4 # nova

lxml # glance keystone
lxml>=2.3 # cinder nova

routes # glance keystone
routes>=1.12.3 # quantum

wsgiref # glance
wsgiref>=0.1.2 # cinder

== SQLAlchemy ==

SQLAlchemy is 'special':

sqlalchemy>=0.7,<=0.7.9 # glance
sqlalchemy>=0.7.3,<=0.7.9 # cinder
sqlalchemy>=0.7.8,<=0.7.9 # nova keystone
sqlalchemy==0.7.9 # quantum

sqlalchemy-migrate>=0.7 # glance
sqlalchemy-migrate>=0.7.2 # cinder nova keystone
